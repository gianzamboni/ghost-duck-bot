You''ll hear less footsteps when a Wraith is around, so if you''ve heard a conspicuous absence of these, you may have one on your hands. NOTE: Just because a Ghost walked into a wall and vanished does not mean that it''s a Wraith. This is a graphical bug and does not rule the Wraith in or out as a suspect.'::text

The fingerprints are easy enough to spot due to how the Poltergeistâ€™s special power works; when the Poltergeist interacts with an object, it ''swings'' and affects multiple objects at once. This means that if you walk into a room and see multiple objects already on the floor before you enter, or if the Ghost whacks a bottle of cream off the sink and turns it on in one go, my money''s on the Poltergeist..'::text
